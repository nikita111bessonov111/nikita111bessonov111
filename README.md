Hi My name is Nikita
QA engineer
An experienced manual tester with a focus on software quality assurance. Currently, I am also actively developing my skills in Python autotesting. Assisted developers and other team members in testing applications to achieve actionable results. Performed defect tracking and logging, developed and implemented test cases to ensure full application functionality coverage. My contributions also included analyzing test results, reporting on application performance and issues identified. In addition, I carefully maintained documentation, including development of checklists to ensure completeness and accuracy of testing.
